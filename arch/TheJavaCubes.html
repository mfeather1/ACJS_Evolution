<h1 align="CENTER">How to use the Cube illustrations.</h1>

<p>
</p><h2>Moving</h2>
<p>
The cubes illustrate a move sequence, which you can go through forwards or 
backwards using the VCR style buttons below them.
</p><p>
You can rotate the whole cube by dragging it with your mouse. 
</p><p>
You can turn the sides by clicking on them while holding down
the shift and/or control key. Shift is clockwise, control anti clockwise, and 
both gives a double turn. <i>If you do this you will get out of sync with the 
move sequence (I will fix that someday), you can always reset with the fast rewind button.</i>

</p><h2>Colors</h2>
<p>
There are several different coloring schemes on available Real World cubes. I use
the one I learned the cube with. It is forever programmed into my
whole being.
</p><p>
It is known as the "plus yellow" coloring, since green (blue + yellow) is opposite blue, 
orange (red + yellow) is opposite red, and yellow (you get it...) is opposite white.
<br>
Maybe someday I'll figure out how to make the coloring settable by the viewer, but
for now this is how it is.

</p><p>
I also use grey for faces that are uninteresting for what I'm illustrating, 
and dark gray for the already solved block of the cube. This is pretty much the 
way I think of the cube when I solve it.

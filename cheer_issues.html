<p>On lrubik, Play does not animate rotation, it only displays the ending
config (after delay of applying the whole move sequence at normal speed).
The single step works but it only changes the color of the facelets
(no animation).
The buttons are sometimes inconsistent in the way they change colors
when Play is pressed.
Other applets do not respond while lrubik is playing a sequence.
<br><br>
On desktop browsers, rotation can only be done within the cube area,
a fix has been implemented for this.
<br><br>
On mobile devices, the buttons do not work on the first cube and the
keyboard pops up on any interaction with any of the cubes (a fix has
been implemented for the keyboard).
<br><br>
On the first cube, sound does not work properly.</p>

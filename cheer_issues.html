<p>On lrubik, Play does not animate rotation, it only displays the ending
config (after delay of applying the whole move sequence).
The single step works but it only changes the color of the facelets
(no animation).
The buttons are sometimes inconsistent in the way they change colors
when Play is pressed.
Other applets do not respond while lrubik is playing a sequence.
<br><br>
On desktop browsers, rotation can only be done within the cube area
(as opposed to mobile devices where rotation extends outside the cube
area).
<br><br>
On mobile devices, the buttons do not work on the first cube and
the keyboard pops up on any interaction with any of the cubes.
<br><br>
On Caesar, use of the ctrl key to apply moves also triggers desktop
shortcuts (ctrl-o pops an "Open File" window for example).
<br><br>
On the first cube, sound does not work sometimes while making moves.</p>
